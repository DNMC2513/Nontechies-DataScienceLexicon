      Code developers must adhere to the instruction and logic flow of the framework.<br />

        <th>Metaphors</th>
        <th>Think of working with a library as cooking at home. <br />

        <th>Think of working a framework as ordering your custom pizza at Dominos's.
      The whole process is fixed. You can only select the ingredients you want in a fixed order. </th>
