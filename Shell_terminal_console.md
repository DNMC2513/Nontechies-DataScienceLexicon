## II, Console:
- a physical terminal connected to a machine. Nowadays, it is rare for us to see such a thing. So we have another version of it: the console in R studio.
- In RStudio, the `console` is a window that allows us to execute our code in R language, and the `terminal` within is the window that will enable us to access the system shell of the laptop.


## III, Variants of Terminal:
- `Command Prompt` is the terminal within a Microsoft Laptop, which has many defects in automation compared to that of a Unix-like OS. To overcome its limits, Microsoft has developed a new terminal with a new type of command, `PowerShell`. The commands specialised for PowerShell are called Cmdlet. They are lightweight and object-oriented and hence more intuitive for users to understand. 
    - We can use Command Prompt commands on Powershell with no further actions.
    - However, to use PowerShell commands on Command Prompt, we must call PowerShell.exe process first.
- `Bash` is the name of the terminal within a Linus or Unix-like OS Computer. An instance of Bash is Git_Bash  
- The commands used on MicorsoftOS Laptop's Terminal and Bash are different from each other.
