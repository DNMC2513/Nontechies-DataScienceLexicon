# Compiled vs Interpreted language


There are two types of programming language:
-	Interpreted programming languages.
-	Compiled languages.


## I, Compiled languages:
-	With a compiled programming language, the source code will be converted into binary language by a compiler within the computer then later stored in the deviceâ€™s hardware. 
-	When a user run the program (written in your source code), the compiled version will be loaded into the memory from the hard disk and executed by a linker software. 
-	The whole process takes place inside the internal operating system of the computer.

-	Pros:
    + Private, high security level.
    + Can be executed faster than interpreted languages.
    
-	Cons:
    + System-dependent, a compiled source code on your computer might not be able to be executed by a Mac laptop.
    + Require extra and more complicated steps to run than interpreted languages. For instance, you might need to worry about whether the computer has enough memory to store and execute the code or not.

-	Instances: C, C++, Objective-C


## II, Interpreted languages:
-	With an interpreted language, the source code will be appraised by lexical analysis by the interpreter. If everything is alright, the code will be interpreted line-by-line into bytecode and then binary code by a remote virtual machine, and then sent to your device to be executed.
-	Pros:
    + System-independent
    + Easier to write a program and run it compared to compiled languages.
  
-	Cons:
    + Lower level of security compared to compiled languages
    + Take a few more tiktoks to execute compiled to compiled languages.

-	Instances: JavaScript, PHP, R, Python(hybrid)
