# A Data Science Lexicon for Nontechies

I started out to learn Data Science with no experience and background in technology and computer science. The learning process was fun and challenging, but I have to admit that the amount of time spent on wrapping my head around the jumble of terminologies was so extensive. Had I found a lexicon with intelligible for dummies in Data Science and Technology, everything would be a lot easier. 

After months of consolidating my knowledge and honing Data Science skills, I decided to compile my understanding on its terminologies and tried to include brief and simple explanation for them.
